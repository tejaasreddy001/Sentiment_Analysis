# Sentiment_Analysis

We are performing Sentiment Analysis on comments left by students on Rate My Professor

# Tasks to be done:
1. This project requires a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the quality and difficulty scores that a student will assign to a set of comments.
2. The comments are provided in text format, and the model should be trained on a dataset that includes ratings for quality and difficulty.
3. Use pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe to improve the model's effectiveness.
   
# About the Dataset:
The project requires a dataset that includes student comments along with ratings for quality and difficulty. Two publicly available datasets that include this information:
1. A larger dataset in CSV format from Dr. Hibo Je at Tsinghua University.
2. A smaller dataset in JSON format from Kaggle containing reviews from the undergraduate Claremont Colleges.
